I am a fourth year Ph.D. programme student from [School of Cyber Science and Engineering](https://scs.njust.edu.cn/main.htm), [Nanjing University of Science and Technology (NJUST)](https://www.njust.edu.cn/). My main research interest includes interpretable deep learning (XAI), adversarial attack in ML (secure AI), computer vision, and data mining.

I am very fortunate to be advised by Prof. Qianmu Li from School of Cyber Science and Engineering, NJUST. I was advised by Prof. Jing Zhang from School of Cyber Science and Engineering, Southeast University.

This is only the very simplest version of my homepage.
